## Life

[R.I.P. John :(](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/science/math-conway-game-of-life.html)

The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

## Rules:
* Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
* Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
* All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

## Warning:
* this code is bad, maybe I'll fix it in 2021
